xml output from the print.
Actually do something with the xml files in test subdir

Make one xml file per SLS message
Make script to merge all SLS into one big xml
Make the structures be defined else where and do an XML include
How to chain command lines based on the SLS message name or number?

Do I need to use CDATA for the nmea payloads in the test directory? 

Do I want to make each message a class?  I am thinking NO. Just adds
more overhead, right?  Let a programmer wrap what is done by the code
generator into a class if they so desire.

Provide each message with a bit length function what has variable lengths

TESTING: need a set of script tests that make sure things like normalize work
