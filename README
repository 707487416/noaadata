Python library for talking to NOAA co-ops data servers and generating
AIS waterlevel messages.

WARNING: This is research code.  Do not expect things to work nicely
and no support unless you work for NOAA or the USCG.

NOAA uses the apache java based Axis engine for SOAP.
http://ws.apache.org/axis

Library for handling marine Automatic Identification System (AIS)
messages and NOAA marine data messages from http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/. 
Has extensions to handle the USCG N-AIS receive fields.  The SOAP code is a bit rusty and now
uses pydap.

For AIS ship traffic, noaadata provides interfaces to sqlite3 and
postgresql/postgis databases.  Is able to generate Google Earth KML
files for AIS.
